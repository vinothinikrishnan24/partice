//1.What is the difference between var, let, and const?var-global/function scope,allows redeclaration and reintization,values can be changed
    let-block scope,allows reinitialization  but not allows redeclaration,values can be changed
    const-block scope,not allows redeclaration and redeclaration,values cannot be changed
//2.Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
var keyword allows redeclaration function scope declared same variable name again the same scope
//3.Which keyword allows reinitialization?
var and let keyword alows the reintization because after variable declared values can be changed using Assignment
//4.	Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
const keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization because once value assgined means its fixed we cannot changed or declared again or reassigned
//5.Why should const be used for fixed values?
prevent value changes,improves code safety,and used value should be remain constant
//6.What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
SyntaxError occurs-Identifier  already been declared
//7.What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
TypeError occurs- Assignment to constant variable
//8.Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
et and const ,because provide block scope and reduce bugs compared to var
//9.Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.
no,must be initialized the time declaration ,other wise it throws a SyntaxError
//10.When should var be avoided?
modern js ,block scope required,avoid redeclaration & hositing issues
// 11.var a=10;
// a=20;
// var a=30;
// console.log(a);
//output-30


//12. let b = 5;
// b=15;
// console.log(b);
//Output: 15

//13. let x =10;
// let x =20; SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared

//14. const y=50;
// y=100; TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.


// 15.Write a program using var to show redeclaration.
var z=70;
// var z=80;
// console.log("var redeclaration:-",z);


// 16.Write a program using let to show reinitialization.
let c=2;
// c=3;
// console.log(c);

//17.Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.
 const d=0;
// d=5// Error: Assignment to constant variable
// console.log(d);

// 18.Convert var to let where applicable.
Before: var age = 5;
//after
let a=3;
//console.log("let:-",b);


//19.Convert var to const where applicable.
Before: var city = "Erode";
//after
//const city ="chennai";
// console.log(city);

// 20.Write your own example for var, let, and const.
var country="India";
// let a=3;
// const pi=3.14;
// console.log("var:-",country);
// console.log("let:-",a);
// console.log("const:-",pi);
